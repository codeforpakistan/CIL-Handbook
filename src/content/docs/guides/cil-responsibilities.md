We know that you are a volunteer with Code for Pakistan and we truly value your commitment for volunteerism with us. All we expect from you is to share your knowledge with the civic tech community, be able to support the communities you come from by working on solutions that can address the civic issues, organize and lead the CIL and ensure volunteer engagement. You are expected to commit at least 5 hours on a weekly basis to carry out the following tasks.

## Key Responsibilities
Identify your CIL [OKRs](https://www.productculture.org/articles/2019/6/1/how-should-product-teams-use-okrs), goals, plans and metrics with help from CfP lead. 

- Commitment to work -- 5 hours per week 
- Holding at least 1 event per quarter which brings together citizens and technologists. 
- Regular meetups for the CIL
- Monthly meetings with CfP Leads
- Update CFP core team during Hangouts on important updates 
- Identification of active citizens and having regular meetings with them to better understand civic problems (building a database of local active citizens)
- Storytelling of your CIL, including a write up on your activities/achievements for each quarter.

Scope new CIL volunteers to team up with you. You may have a community lead, a technologist, a liaison lead and a content writer as part of your team

- Community lead: a community lead is someone who knows how to build relationships within the ecosystem, build traction towards the CIL and takes a lead on community events.

- Technologist: you need to have a technologist on the team to work on tech projects. It’s always handy to have more than one technologist with diverse skill sets on your team.

- Liaison lead: a liaison lead works closely with the government and private sector partners. They bring in new connections and maintain the existing ones.

- Content writer: your content writer will be responsible for developing content based on your upcoming events and projects and handle social media. 

Once you have selected your team members, give them clear responsibilities, identify the number of hours they will volunteer per week, set up a shared communications channel preferably Slack and select your first project to work on. Here’s how you can join [CfP’s Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-pk/help/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel) channel after signing up on Slack. 

- Meet with the CIL volunteers either in-person or online to discuss new opportunities on a monthly basis.
