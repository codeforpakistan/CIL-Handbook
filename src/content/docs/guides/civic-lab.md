## Karachi Civic Innovation Lab 
The Karachi CIL is a community of contributors from the public sector, non-profit and software development communities. The members come together to work on projects that improve social services delivery through digital platforms (web/mobile apps, open data initiatives). The KCIL is also interested in creating interest in the open source community and increasing women’s participation in technology through training initiatives.

The core members of the KCIL are known as “leads”. A lead is responsible for organizing all the support and resources required to execute a specific project. Other members of the KCIL (software developers, public sector experts) may either stay with the KCIL for the duration of a specific project or become a regular contributor.
