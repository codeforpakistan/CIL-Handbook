To think like a designer requires dreaming up wild ideas, taking time to tinker and test, and being willing to fail early and often. The designer's mindset embraces empathy, optimism, iteration, creativity, and ambiguity. And most critically, design thinking keeps people at the center of every process. A human-centered designer knows that as long as you stay focused on the people you're designing for—and listen to them directly—you can arrive at optimal solutions that meet their needs.

IDEO is a leading [design consultancy](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-agency) and has developed its own version of the design thinking framework.

IDEO’s design thinking process is a cyclical three-step process that involves Inspiration, Ideation and Implementation.

In the “Inspire” phase, the team focuses on understanding users’ needs, behaviors, and motivations. The team empathizes with people through observation and user interviews to gather deep insights.

In the “Ideate” phase, the team synthesizes the insights gained to brainstorm a wide array of creative solutions. This stage encourages divergent thinking, where teams focus on quantity and variety of ideas over immediate practicality. The goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible without constraints. 

In the “Implement” phase, the team brings these ideas to life through prototypes. The team tests, iterates and refines these ideas based on user feedback. This stage is crucial for translating abstract concepts into tangible, viable products, services, or experiences. The methodology emphasizes collaboration and a multidisciplinary approach throughout each phase to ensure solutions are innovative and deeply rooted in real human needs and contexts.

## How Design Thinking Differs from Traditional Problem-Solving Approaches
Design thinking is in contrast to more traditional problem-solving methods. Historically, many fields and industries employed a more linear process (sometimes called “Waterfall”), which defined a problem from a business standpoint and approached it with a rigid, one-step-after-the-other procedure. Truly creative solutions are less ordered.

Design thinking takes a non-linear, flexible approach focused on empathy and user feedback (sometimes called “Agile”). Instead of thinking about problems from the perspective of what a business wants to do, design thinking starts with considering what potential customers want and need. The consideration of human desires means the process has to be less analytical and more empathetic. Before you can brainstorm, you have to listen. Rather than focusing on sales margins and statistics, you concentrate on solutions and specific users. 

Of note is the importance of the reference and value of a problem statement, which you build in the Define phase. It’s a balance of focus and flexibility that keeps you on track but leaves room for creativity. Your problem statement is a sentence or question that defines the purpose of your project (the solution). Once you’ve gathered a wealth of information during the Empathize phase, you analyze it to define the core problems that need solving. It’s vital that you keep the problem statement human-centered. This isn’t about who your brand wants to be or statistics about customer satisfaction. It’s about something people need, such as nutritious food, affordable home supplies or engaging entertainment. When your problem statement centers on a user need, your team can creatively build the best solution. If the statement is a business goal, the team won’t be as connected to what their work does for people. And it’s that connection to real people and their needs that will, ultimately, lead to a better product.
