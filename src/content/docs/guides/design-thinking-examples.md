So, what does design thinking look like in practice? These real-world examples from Harvard Business School should make things a bit clearer.

## Airbnb
Early on, Airbnb's founders realized that the images on their site were deterring rather than exciting renters. To deepen their empathy with users, they went to the various rental locations to see what users wanted to view on the site. Rather than obsess over increasing traffic and revenue, they defined the problem (poor, lacking images) and pondered how to improve it. They implemented the practice of taking high-quality pictures of the whole property and including more enticing information in the listing (hot tub, nearby attractions). After a week, Airbnb’s revenue doubled.

## GE Healthcare
It doesn’t get much more important than children’s healthcare. A case study of a GE product demonstrates just how big a difference design thinking can make in people’s lives. MRIs are difficult for children especially, as they must be still in an unfamiliar, dark environment. Hearing the feedback of parents, technicians and children, GE Healthcare developed technology that turned MRI machine interiors into scenes of pirate chips, beaches and the ocean. In turning a hard situation into an adventure, GE Healthcare saw patient satisfaction increase by 90%. 

## Clean Team
There are many great examples of how design thinking has been applied to the social sector. This case study describes Clean Team, which applied design thinking to provide in-home toilets for Ghana’s urban poor.

The case study describes the project and its success: “For the millions of Ghanaians without in-home toilets, there are few good options when it comes to our bodies’ most basic functions. Working with Unilever and Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP), and IDEO.org developed Clean Team, a comprehensive sanitation system that delivers and maintains toilets in the homes of subscribers. Clean Team now serves 5,000 people in Kumasi, Ghana, making lives cleaner, healthier, and more dignified.”

## Uber Eats

[This article](https://medium.com/uber-design/how-we-design-on-the-ubereats-team-ff7c41fffb76) by a former designer on the UberEATS team describes how they approach their food delivery service with a design thinking mindset. 

One of the top takeaways from the article is how empathy is essential to their practice: “To understand all our different markets and how our products fit into the physical conditions of each city, we constantly immerse ourselves in the places where our customers live, work, and eat. Sitting in our offices in San Francisco or New York, we can’t truly understand the experiences of a person on the streets of Bangkok or London.”

                 The UberEATS team believes empathy for users is key to designing successful products.

## Oral B
Oral-B, a renowned brand in oral hygiene products, has consistently leveraged design thinking principles across its product development and innovation endeavors. Notably, one standout project showcasing the effective application of design thinking is the redesign of Oral-B's children's toothbrush.

### How they use design thinking
Oral-B's Children's Toothbrush exemplified a comprehensive integration of design thinking principles, from empathizing to testing. The initiative was driven by two key challenges:

- Creating a children's toothbrush that transformed oral hygiene into an enjoyable experience for young users.
- Enhancing the toothbrush design to meet children's needs and gain a competitive edge in the market.


To address these challenges, Oral B partnered with IDEO and conducted extensive observational research to comprehend children's interactions with the product. Through this process, the design team observed that children tended to grasp the toothbrush with their palms rather than their fingers due to limited dexterity. This user insight led to the creation of a prototype solution named the "Squish Gripper."


### Application of Design Thinking by Oral B
The children's toothbrush featured the “Squish Gripper”, a wider handle with a soft texture grip, facilitating easier handling for children. This aspect was crucial as many existing children's toothbrushes on the market were essentially scaled-down versions of adult products, lacking consideration for a child's grip strength. Subsequently, the prototype underwent testing with young users, who were observed while using the product. The team also incorporated vibrant colors and engaging graphics to appeal to children and make them look forward to brushing their teeth. 

### What you can learn from Oral B
Oral-B's children's toothbrush exemplifies the power of accurate observation in driving success. By delving into why children held the toothbrush with their palms instead of fingers, designers uncovered a gap between needs and market supply, paving the path to eventual success.

## Is Design Thinking Intuitive?
The iterative nature of design thinking often leads to the misconception that the process is inherently intuitive. This is especially apparent in activities like empathizing and brainstorming, which may seem subjective and instinctual. However, it's crucial to understand that mastering design thinking requires dedicated time and effort. Even fundamental principles such as empathy and brainstorming necessitate a structured approach to effectively filter out a designer's preconceptions and biases. Tools like empathy mapping, journey maps, and [persona creation](https://www.andacademy.com/resources/blog/ui-ux-design/personas-in-design-thinking/) serve as essential aids in this regard.

For individuals more accustomed to linear, analytical problem-solving approaches, the open-ended nature of design thinking can present unique challenges. In such cases, seeking professional guidance through a formal design thinking course can be the most effective way to adopt the required mindset.
